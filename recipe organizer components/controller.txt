The mixture should be very moist, but not dripping.\r\nChill the meat mixture for 15 to 30 minutes in the refrigerator, to make the meatballs easier to form.\r\nHeat the margarine in a large skillet over medium heat.

Place the meatballs into the heated skillet, and fry for about 15 minutes per side, until the meatballs are well-browned and no longer pink in the center."
