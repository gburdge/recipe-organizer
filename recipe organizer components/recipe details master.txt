url:  http://tinyurl.com/n6xaffd

Description:
Straight from Denmark this is a little labor-intensive, but once you get the hang of it, you'll be addicted! Serve warm with a brown sauce, small red boiled potatoes, and sweet and sour Danish red cabbage.

Ingredients:
makes 24 meatballs
prep & cook time: 65 minutes
 1/2 pound ground veal or lean ground meat
 1/2 pound ground pork
 1/4 cup milk, or as needed
 1/4 cup finely grated onion
 1 egg
 1/4 cup bread crumbs, or as needed
 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
 1/4 cup 7-Up
 salt and pepper to taste
 1/4 cup margarine

Instructions:
Mix the veal and pork together in a bowl, and stir in the milk, onion, and egg. Mix the bread crumbs into the meat. Sprinkle in the flour, and knead well to mix. Stir in the seltzer water, season to taste with salt and pepper, and mix well. The mixture should be very moist, but not dripping.
Chill the meat mixture for 15 to 30 minutes in the refrigerator, to make the meatballs easier to form.
Heat the margarine in a large skillet over medium heat.
To form meatballs, scoop up about 2 1/2 tablespoons of meat mixture with a large spoon, and form the mixture into a slightly flattened, oval meatball about the size of a small egg. Place the meatballs into the heated skillet, and fry for about 15 minutes per side, until the meatballs are well-browned and no longer pink in the center.

Red Berry Pudding with Cream (Rødgrød med fløde paa)
makes 4 servings

Description:
Rødgrød med fløde, red berry pudding with cream, is the hallmark dessert of Denmark. Use tart berries like red currants if you can find them; if using strawberries, reduce the amount of sugar so it isn't too sweet. Many recipes include rhubarb as well.

Ingredients:
makes 4 servings
prep & cook time: 30 minutes

1 1/2 lb. red berries or fruit (red currants, black currants, raspberries, strawberries, rhubarb, or a combination)
3 cups water
1 cup sugar
1/4 cup potato starch or cornstarch, dissolved in 1/2 cup cold water
1 cup heavy cream, plain or whipped with 1 Tbsp. vanilla sugar

Instructions:
Clean the fruit well; chop rhubarb, if using, into 1-inch pieces. Place into nonreactive saucepan and cover with 3 cups water; simmer over medium low heat until the fruit falls apart. Remove from heat and strain juice through cheesecloth or a fine-meshed sieve; dispose of berry seeds.
Return juice to heat, stir in sugar, and bring to a low boil; reduce heat to medium and add the dissolved potato flour liquid to thicken. Stir the mixture constantly until it begins to gel to the consistency of a heavy syrup. Remove from heat, pour into individual serving bowls, cover with cling wrap, and refrigerate for at least two hours and up to two days. Serve chilled with either plain or whipped cream.
